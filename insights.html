            extrapolating the limits of a fictional narrative, the project started with an adaptation of Bruno Nuytten’s
            1988 <i>Camille Claudel</i>. the biographical movie focuses on the story of the french sculptress named
            aforehand,
            shadowed by society’s norms and concepts.
            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; she is a lonely woman, fueled by her art and desires, pursuing to
            make a name for herself in the artistic society. quickly, she understands that her position in this world is
            unattainable, as she is constantly shadowed by a male figure, Auguste Rodin, and succumbs to a spiraling
            madness, fuelled by rejection and paranoia. the movie, in its essence, isn’t about Camille Claudel’s art but
            about her personality, passions and struggles.

              it shows a lonely woman, fighting against society’s norms and expectations in order to do with her life
              what her society says no decent woman should do. choosing to love who she wants, and chasing after her
              desire to be an artist, to create sculptures out of clay, just as if she were a man. when she is driven to
              madness, it’s impossible to discern whether the impromptu was there from the beginning, or whether she was
              driven to madness by a strict society that couldn’t accept a woman who lived for herself.
              <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; through the highlighting of themes like the rebellion against society’s
              norms and epistemes, female
              empowerment and perceptual relativity of reality, the construction of a new fiction began, anchored in
              these themes. since Camille was only marginalized because of what the late 19th century society deemed fit
              for a woman, how this mindset was adopted was questioned. in a world where a woman wasn’t expected to be
              submissive to a man, could she have been whoever she pleased? could she have loved whoever she wanted to
              love? how did the subconscious endorse these imperatives? could our subconscious be molded by what each
              epoch has as absolute, proper and indisputed? what are the dimensions beyond what we perceive as an
              absolute truth?

            <b>nuances of a mirage</b> arises as a project that intends to instill an interior reflection, incremented
            by the
            introduction of the premise that everyone lives in a distinct reality, characterized by individual
            experiences and molded by epistemes inherent to every epoch, that unconsciously guide society’s judgment. by
            introducing the possibility of the existence of new perspectives beyond the first interpretation of a given
            subject, the project proposes the creation of a heterotopia that questions the concept of absolute truths.
            it promotes a return to an innocent outlook on the world and its observation. by ingraining such reflexive
            thoughts into the spectators mind, the project aims to instigate an exercise of self-dissociation, building
            towards a prejudice-free understanding and acceptance of the existence of different realities from one’s
            own, where the ultimate goal is to reach a state of harmony.
