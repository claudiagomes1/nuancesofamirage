            by deviating from the fiction at hand, the group explored different but correlated and interrelated themes,
            with the purpose of further understanding the narrative at hand.
            <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; the fiction compositions are individual audiovisual essays that expose each
            group member’s perspective on the fiction created by the collective. this perspective could explore a
            particular aspect of the collective fiction, offer itself as a variation/extension to the theme, or present
            itself as an alternative or counter-proposal.

                a discussion about the unfolding of a certain event can evoke memories derived from experiencing it —
                how things happened, the consequent emotions. though, can we be sure that the same event is drawn in
                identical outlines, and translated into the same emotional responses for each participant? can we even
                be sure that our collective recollection of a given event doesn’t merely consist in a fabricated memory?
                is it possible that the description of said event derives from such a familiar place that we trick
                ourselves into believing to have lived through it?

                people often think of memory as something like a real-time video recorder, accurately documenting and
                storing everything that happens with perfect accuracy and clarity. however, our memories aren’t absolute
                representations of reality, but subjective perceptions instead. they are constantly being affected by
                external sources, that being misinformation or suggestibility of allegedly existing knowledge or other
                ‘undeniable’ memories, which interferes with the development of a new memory, causing the recollection
                of an event to be mistaken or entirely false.
                <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<i>ambiguous recollections</i> is a short docu-fiction that
                addresses the plasticity of our recollections as supposedly reliable representations of reality and the
                importance of accepting the fundamental truth about own experiences, which sometimes may not correspond
                to reality itself.

                has it ever crossed your mind that sometimes, not having to rationalize your existence, allows you to
                fully experience a certain situation? that by revoking what your mind tells you to think, you allow
                yourself to be immersed in the moment. enjoy your surroundings and perceive things in their essence.
                <i>thoughtless bliss</i> is a journey through a speculative world, characterized by the non-existence of
                epistemes. it praises the freedom that the pure existence without knowledge and reason enables. it
                inserts the condition that bliss can be reached, not through ignorance but through the clearance of the
                mind.

                culture plays an important role in shaping a person, creating an unique vision of the reality in which
                he or she finds him or herself, and this perception of reality relates to aspects such as environment,
                language, interaction with people, dietary habits, among others. however, we have to take into account
                an important characteristic that often ends up being ignored, our visual perception. visual perception
                is an ability to understand everything around us. colors, figures, movements, and other factors are
                processed in different areas of the brain, which is considered to be an extremely complex system,
                through which this perception of reality takes place.
                <br> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;the short film <i>Cultural Perception</i> aims to rethink what are
                considered the absolute truths through
                visual perception, the reality that each of us sees and considers as the absolute truth. this absolute
                truth is only one of the characteristics defined by culture that directly influences our perception of
                reality. through Gestalt principles, it is intended to represent the premise that absolute truth does
                not exist, only different realities and individual perception exist.
